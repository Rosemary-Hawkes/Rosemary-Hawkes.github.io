      <h2>My core personal values</h2>
      <p>I believe that individuality, freedom, autonomy and independence are the building blocks of a fulfilling life experience.
        Each person's life journey is theirs to choose and to gain meaning from.  Your experience along the way is up to you and depends on
        your attitude and application - excellence is certainly not a requirement! It can be challenging to 
        own your individuality and follow a different path to what is expected of you.  Those that work to ensure inclusiveness and fairness in their society or group
        make the journey easier and more meaningful for others.</p>

        My Myers Briggs profile is INTJ (introverted, intuitive, thinking, judging).  Interestingly I've done this assessment a number of times
        over the years and ended up with the same profile every time (even after diverse life experiences).  This intrigued me so I 
        researched and found that MBTI profiles tend to stay the same over a person's life, even when they have experienced a wide range 
        of life events. This suggests that core values and preferences (indicated by your MBTI score) are
        embedded at an early age and are not affected greatly by specific life events.

     
        <h2>Ethics and decision making</h2>
        <p>When facing ethical decisions I first aim to gain and validate as much information as possible so that I can make an informed decision.  When deciding which option
          to take I will always choose the one that aligns with my core values.  I need to feel that 
          I can advocate for the decision I have made which is why I examine my underlying reasons for choosing a specific option.
        <p>
          
        <h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a very traditional kiwi setting with an emphasis on humility and hard work.  Whilst I respect my 
          parents for instilling these values in me I have found that to achieve meaning in life it is important to have the courage
          to spread your wings and try a few things that would be considered calculated risks.  By trying different things, and sometimes failing, 
          you end up a much stronger person with skills that benefit you for life.</p>
      

        <h2>Strengths that will assist with learning obstacles </h2>
        <p>I'm motivated and excited to be part of the Kahu cohort.  I feel that I have alot to offer in terms of
          life experience and am looking to develop the skills I already have by learning from my team members.  I'm comfortable 
          with giving and receiving constructive feedback and will be seeking to utiliise this skill
          during my learning journey.  As I progress through Foundations I'm learning alot from others, particularly the 
          skill of breaking down a problem into manageable parts and persisting to work through obstacles.</p>
