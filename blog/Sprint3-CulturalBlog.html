      <h2>The difference between EQ and IQ</h2>
      <p>Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is a measure of a persons ability to reason and solve problems and is expressed as a number. IQ tests measure cognitive power, working memory, reasoning, problem solving and the ability to arrive at a conclusion with incomplete or unstructured data.</p>
        
      <p>Emotional Quotient (EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to communicate well with others, overcome challenges and deal productively with conflict or uncertainty.  It isn't expressed as a numercial value but does consist of the following four attributes: self management, self-awareness, social awareness and relationship management.</p>
    
      <h2>Why is EQ so important?</h2>
      <p>EQ is like a glue that connects understanding and emotion you feel. It makes us resilient, motivated, and able to read and navigate a range of social situations and conflicts. By taking some time and effort to develop your EQ you are more likely to a lead a meaningful and happy life with genuine connections.
            
      <p>Practical things you can do immediately enhance your EQ include:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Utilising clear and assertive communication so that those who you come in to contact with are aware of your expectations and you are aware of theirs</li>
      <li>Responding instead of reacting to conflict by making mindfulness practice a daily habit.</li>
      <li>Utilising active listening skills so that you are able to have a really clear understanding amongst team members of what the teams goals and objectives are.</li>
      <li>Giving and accepting constructive criticism in a non-judgemental and "open" way.</li>
      <li>Empathising with others by stepping into their shoes from time to time and looking at the world from their perspective.</li>
      </ol>
