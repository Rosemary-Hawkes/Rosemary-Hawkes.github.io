    <h1>Core Learnings</h1>

      <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>I've found when I feel like I've almost reached my limit in terms of working through a problem I still have a bit more reserve left and am able to use this to push through to achieve a result.  I've also found that my values align really well with that of Dev Academy and I'm looking forward to the experience of learning in an environment that supports diversity and encourages creativity in problem solving.  Another valuable insight I've gained is that when something seems incredibly complex it is always possible to break it down in to manageable chunks and deal with one component at a time.  The coding videos have been so helpful in training me to break down something complex down into manageable parts.</p>   

      <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>Empathy involves shared perspectives or emotions.  In working with others it's much easier to achieve the teams goals when everyone has an awareness of others perspectives and is able to recognise emotions in others.  Insight into your own emotions as well of those of others means that you can adjust your responses early and reduce overall risk of the project not achieving it's end goal. </p>
    
      <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>I really enjoyed the core component of the curriculum and although I've felt pretty confident that my core skills are well developed I've gained some really valuable insights from the blogs of others in Kahu.  It's been helpful reading how diverse our experiences in Foundations have been and ways that people have dealt with challenges.</P>

      <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>For me the hardest part was pushing through when things have been challenging as well as combining learning with working full time.  I'm looking forward to being able to devote 100% of my time to bootcamp and appplying what I've learned so far in interpersonal team situations at bootcamp and after graduation.</p>

      <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
      <p>Human skills are critical because they help build relationships and others tend to want to work with people who they like and trust.  It's important to know that your teammates have your back and you are all aligned to the same goals.  Those who have taken time to develop their core skills always tend to do better because they are able to connect with other on a deeper level and use this connection to bring out the best in people and situations.</p>    

      <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
      </h2>
      <p>I'm really grateful that there has been such an emphasis on this aspect in addition to technical skills.  The two skillsets go hand in hand and having top level technical skills alone will not be enough to participate in a team that requires human connection, empathy and cohesiveness.</p>
