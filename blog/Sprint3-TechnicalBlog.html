      <h2>HTML and CSS - how are they different?</h2>
        <p>HTML is a programming tool that describes the structure and contents of a web page.  It lists all elements (components) that the web page contains and labels each element using standardised tags with angle brackets.  Some elements such as images and user input introduce content into the page.  Other tags surround content and provide information and the document object.  
        
        HTML tags enable the element to be referenced elsewhere in the document object so that functionality and styling can be added.  Styling of elements is prescribed in a CSS document which contains groups of styles particular to particular HTML tags.  This interactivity between HTML and CSS enables all elements with the same tag to be consistently styled and the code for the styling is only required to be written and recorded once in the document object.  
        
        An analogy to describe the relationship between HTML and CSS would be an architects plan of a house to be built denotes the proposed structures (stairway, hall, rooms) and an interior designers plan of the same house, detailing the appearance (wall colour, flooring type, window frame design and colour).</p>  
        
        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
        <p>Control flow describes a series of actions taken in a specific sequence.  When processes need to be performed repeatedly it is ideal to standardise them so the output after each iteration is the same (or as similar as possible).  This means that variability of input is minimised and smaller amounts of code can achieve the same objective.ess decision making is required;
           
            An example of Control Flow is the making of school lunches in my house:
               1. Ask children to retrieve lunchboxes from bags.
               2. Repeat.
               3. Retrieve lunch boxes from bags myself.
               4. Empty uneaten food (and other items) from lunchboxes.
               5. Wash lunchboxes.
               6. Dry lunchboxes.
               6. Assemble a collection of food items.
               8. Place food items in lunchboxes.
               9. Place lunchboxes in school bags.
               10. Repeat on the morning of the following school day.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Demystified: The DOM and Dev Tools</h2>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and is an object-oriented representation of the HTML structure of a webpage. The HTML elements are represented as objects and nodes. The document object is the interface with the websites content and allows functionality to be added (via scripting languages) and styling to be added (via CSS).  Some elements are viewed in the browser and others are not but are still objects that can be interacted with, such as a database that stores user input and returns certain pieces of this data to the browser when a particular function is called.</p>

        <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
        <p>Accessing data from an array of objects is done via bracket notation.  This allows a specific item (index) in the array to be selected or the contents of the entire array.  Accessing data from objects is done via dot notation and where you specify the object followed a dot then the property you wish to retrieve from that</p>

       
    <h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
        <p>Functions are reusable pieces of code that have been standardised to accommodate all variations of user input. It can be thought of as a group of instructions that performs a task or calculates a value.  Functions take input from the user and provide output that is relative to the input.  For for example adding two numbers together (input) to provide the sum (output)). To use the function it must be defined in the scope from where is is called.</p>
