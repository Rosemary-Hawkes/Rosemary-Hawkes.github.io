      <h2>HTML and CSS - how are they different?</h2>
        <p>HTML is a programming tool that describes the structure and contents of a web page.  It lists all elements (components) that the web page contains and labels each element using standardised tags with angle brackets.  Some elements such as images and user input introduce content into the page.  Other tags surround content and provide information abou the document object.  
        
        HTML tags enable the element to be referenced elsewhere in the document object so that functionality and styling can be added.  Styling of elements is prescribed in a CSS document which contains styles specific to each HTML tag.  This interactivity between HTML and CSS enables all elements with the same tag to be consistently styled and the code for the styling is only required to be written and recorded once in the document object.  
        
        An analogy to describe the relationship between HTML and CSS would be an architects plan of a house to be built - denoting the proposed structures (stairway, hall, rooms) and an interior designers plan of the same house, detailing the appearance of these structures (wall colour, flooring type, window frame design and colour).</p>  
        
        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>
        <p>Control flow describes a series of steps and evaluations taken in a specific sequence. It is the order that function calls, instructions, and statements are executed or evaluated when a program is running. Control flow is a way of standardising processes by determining what section of code is run in a program at a given time. An everday example of Control Flow is the making of school lunches in my house:</p>
          <ol> <li>Ask children to retrieve lunchboxes from bags.</li>
               <li>Repeat Step 1.</li>
               <li>Retrieve lunch boxes from bags myself.</li>
               <li>Check if there is uneaten food/debris in lunchbox.</li>
               <li>If yes, empty uneaten food (and other items) from lunchboxes.</li>
               <li>Wash lunchboxes.</li>
               <li>Dry lunchboxes.</li>
               <li>Assemble a collection of food items.</li>
               <li>Place food items in lunchboxes.</li>
               <li>Place lunchboxes in school bags.</li>
               <li>Repeat on the morning of the following school day.</li>
           </ol>
        </p>
            
        <h2>Demystified: The DOM and Dev Tools</h2>
        <p>DOM stands for Document Object Model and is an object-oriented representation of the HTML structure of a webpage. The HTML elements are represented as objects and nodes. The document object is the interface with the websites content and allows functionality to be added (via scripting languages) and styling (with CSS). Some elements are viewed in the browser and can be interacted with by the user.  Other elements are not visible in the browser but are still interacted with as the website functions. For example, a database that stores user input and returns certain pieces of this data to the browser when a particular function is called. Dev Tools is an intuitive and flexible tool that allows you to maintain a high level "view" of the document object and its components while also allowing you to "drill down" on a section of code to determine how the code is interacting with other components of the website. 
        </p>

        <h2>Accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
        <p>Accessing data from an array of objects is done via bracket notation.  This allows a specific item (index) in the array to be selected or the contents of the entire array to be selected.  Accessing data from objects is done via dot notation where the object is specified, followed a dot, then the property to be retrieved from that object:</p>
        
        <div id = "tech3code">
        <img src="Access array.png" class="accessarray" alt="accessarray">
        <p></p>
        <img src="Access object.png" class="accessobject" alt="accessobject">
        </div>

    <h2>Functions and why they are useful</h2>
        <p>Functions are reusable pieces of code that have been standardised to accommodate all variations of user input. They can be thought of as a set of instructions that performs a task or calculates a value.  Functions take input from the user and provide output that is relative to the input (fosr example adding two numbers together (input) to provide the sum (output)). When processes need to be performed repeatedly it is ideal to standardise them so the output after each iteration is the same (or as similar as possible).  This means that variability of input is minimised, smaller amounts of code can achieve the same objective and less decision making is required. To use the function it must be defined in the scope from where it is called.</p>
