      <h2>What is Neuroplasticity and how does it influence learning?</h2>
      <p>Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to learn new things. When we first learn a new skill our brain can find it hard to process and retain the information however as we practice how new skill the neurons in the brain create new patterns which makes learning the skill easier as you go along. Children learn very quickly because their brains are still actively creating new patterns all the time and soaking up information. However by the time you are an adult many of the patterns are already formed and so learning new ones can be challenging.  In an adult, many patterns are already formed so learning new ones can be more difficult.</p>   

      <h2>How is neuroplasticity relevant to learning?</h2>
      <p>The good news is that neuroplasticity is fluid at all ages and learning a new way of doing the same thing creates new patterns in the brain.Practising a skill repeatedly is the best way to embed these new patterns in your brain so that your ability to deal with the complexity of a new task increases over time. If a connection is used regularly or practised, then the neural pathway is strengthened and becomes more effortless. If the same connection or pathway is not used frequently the connection is weakened or lost.</p>

      Another major mediator of plasticity is brain derived neurotrophic factor, or BDNF, which regulates axonal growth and remodeling, as well as synapse formation and function. Axons are the (relatively) long, slender structures linking two neurons together; synapses are the junctions where axons connect to neurons. BDNF is remarkably “activity-dependent,” meaning we can affect its expression by performing certain behaviors.</p>
    
      <h2>Enhancing your neuroplasticity</h2>
      <p>For those of us on accelerated learning journeys (like Dev Academy) there are many ways we can enhance our neuroplasticity.  Our brains contain an enzyme called brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and this is the magic potion that regulates brain growth remodelling.  Luckily our levels of BDNF are extrememly “activity-dependent,” meaning we can increase our levels by practising certain behaviours on a regular basis. These include getting sufficient sleep, consuming nutrients containing magnesium and omega-3 (fish), regular exercise and most importantly exercising your brain.</P>

      <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>Growth mindset is the belief that a person's ability and intelligence can be developed through practice, perserverance, dedication and motivation.  It is the opposite of Fixed mindset which is the belief these same qualities are static and unable to be cultivated or enhanced.  People with fixed mindsets are more likely to fear failure, give up to easy, avoid challenges, and feel threatened by the success of others.  Whereas a Growth Mindset means that a person takes risks, seeks feedback, learns from their mistakes and is motivated to put effort in to succeed and face challenges head on.</p>
