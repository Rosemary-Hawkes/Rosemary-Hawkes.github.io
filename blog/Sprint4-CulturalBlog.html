      <h2>What is Neuroplasticity and how does it influence learning?</h2>
        <p>Neuroplasticity is our brain's ability to learn new things. When we first learn a new skill our brain can find it hard to process and retain the information however as we practice how new skill the neurons in the brain create new patterns which makes learning the skill easier as you go along. Children learn very quickly because their brains are still actively creating new patterns all the time and soaking up information. However by the time you are an adult many of the patterns are already formed and so learning new ones can be challenging.  In an adult, many patterns are already formed so learning new ones can be more difficult.</p>   


    <h2>How is neuroplasticity relevant to learning?</h2>
    The good news is that neuroplasticity is fluid at all ages and learning a new way of doing the same thing creates new patterns in the brain.Practising a skill repeatedly is the best way to embed these new patterns in your brain so that your ability to deal with the complexity of a new task increases over time.   
    If a connection is used regularly or practised, then the neural pathway is strengthened and becomes more effortless. If the same connection or pathway is not used frequently the connection is weakened or lost.
