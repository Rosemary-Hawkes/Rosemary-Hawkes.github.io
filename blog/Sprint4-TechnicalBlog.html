        <h2>A coding problem...and how I got unblocked</h2>
            <p>The DeBee problem had me scratching my head a bit until I broke it down in to manageable steps and used pseudocode for the first time.  I outlined the problem in simple steps and also did a diagram (as I'm a visual person) that showed the movement of data. I read up on the filter method and with this was able to create a new array with all the array elements that did not fit the criteria (they needed to have the same characters as a specific word - "buzz") with one line of code. I then needed to tackle how to bring these elements back together as one string by concatentating them into a single object which was pretty easy to work out as we've had a bit of practice using in-built methods. Interestingly the filter function has only been around in Javascript since the ES6 version and before that you would have needed to use a lot more complex code - such as a for loop - to extract elements from an object.</p>   

        <h2>Pseudocode</h2>
            <p>To me using pseudocode is similar to drawing a plan of a house before you build it or outlining a project before you start it.  You need to identify what steps need to happen (ie. what data needs to be fed into where).  Pseudocode states in simple steps what needs to happen when a block of code is executed.  The way that each person writes pseudocode is unique to them and the form and syntax don't matter as long as it helps you find a workable solution to your coding problem. I've found some really useful examples online of pseudocode for more complex, longer methods that involve user input which I'll keen in mind for later on when things get super challenging.  I also draw data flow diagrams along with my pseudocode as I find I need to have a really clear visualisation of what piece of data is going where.</p>

        <h2>Trying something</h2>
            <p>I tend to dive in early because I like to get an idea of how challenging the exercise will be and I prefer to not linger too long on researching a method before I give it a go. However I've learned that it's better to dive in with clear intention.  Spending more than around 15-30 minutes on a problems that you don't have enough information to solve is not an efficient use of your time. If you are at this point it's better to stop, reflect and attempt to formulate a question around what you are trying to do or what logic you are trying to test.</p>  

        <h2>The Rubber ducky method</h2>
            <p>I had never heard of this method before but really like it as it forces me to clarify the problem in the simplest way possible. I also find that writing the problem down (as if I'm writing to someone) seems to stimulate the problem solving process.  This combined with a short break is often the best way to work through being blocked.</p>

        <h2>>Reading error messages</h2>
            <p>I'm sure everyone experiences that feeling of anticipating after you hit "run" and you wait to see if the test response is in white or red text.  I find the lack of specificity of some error messages a bit frustrating but it is useful that they pinpoint the exact place in the code where there is an issue.</p>

        <h2>Console.logging</h2>
            <p>This method is useful because you can pinpoint by line where your code is failing.  Much more efficient than having an error message and needing to backtrack through several lines of code after you've completed them.</p>

        <h2>Googling</h2>
            <p>This would be my go-to method at the moment and I'm getting much better at formulating short, specific questions.  Although the amount of information that comes back can be overwhelming I'm sticking to the MDN and W3 websites as I find these a lot more oriented to beginners.  Stack Overflow is excellent for a wide variety of answers but I find sifting through the multitude of responses a bit overwhelming.</p>

        <h2>Asking for help</h2>
            <p>I feel comfortable reaching out as we are all on the same journey.  I've been really lucky with team mates getting in touch when I've struggled with solving the challenges.</p>

        
        <h2>Asking coaches for help</h2>
            <p>I've got a really great facilitator, John, who is super helpful and restates my questions in a way that makes me look at the problem in a different way and come up with the next steps myself.</p>
        
        <h2>Improving your process with reflection</h2>
            <p>I'm finding that a couple of days after I've been working on a challenge I will reflect back and the solution will seem so much clearer than when I'm in the middle of solving it.  I also find that going back and repeating the exercise is great for reinforcing concepts. I've also found that reflecting back on how I manage to solve a problem which at first glance looks pretty scary is great for my confidence.</p>
