      <h2>Long term goals and career pathway</h2>
        <p>My idea role is one that allows me to spend my day problem solving and creating in a way
        that has a positive impact on others.  My science background has highlighted the need in the science
        community for tools that allow the exploration and visualisation of 
        scientific data without the requirement for high level programming skills - and with interfaces
        that are intuitive and reponsive. The aesthetic aspect of programming also 
        interests me and I would like to explore this during my journey with Dev Academy. I thrive in inclusive working environments where individuality and differences are 
        accepted without question.</p>
    
        <h2>Human skills I'd like to develop</h2>
        <p>I'm keen to enhance my active listening skills and explore strategies for working with others in challenging situtations so that
          the whole team is cohesive and productive. I would also like to develop my resilience in situations when I am blocked
          and need to perservere to find a solution to a problem. I'm always looking to fine-tune my problem
          solving skills by exploring other, more creative ways of working through problems. The bootcamp phase will
          be an excellent opportunity to connect with others in my cohort and be inspired by their different
          approaches to problem solving.
       
          
        <h2>My strengths and limitations</h2>
        <p>I work best when I'm connecting and working with a diverse range of people. I'm a good listener
          and work hard to understand the essence of what a colleague is trying to communicate.
        I make an effort to let others be heard, appreciated and valued and then to bring the best ideas forward so that we achieve more as a group than we would individually.
        I can sometimes take longer than others to pick up concepts and make connections because I want to understand
        them thoroughly.  However I'm learning how to be comfortable with uncertainty when I'm learning new things and recognising when I 
        know enough to solve the immediate problem at hand.</p>
      

        <h2>How will I manage my workload and other commitments</h2>
        <p>I've been planning to attend EDA for a long time and have put in place a schedule that 
          works for me and my family.  I'm lucky that I have a good support system and by nature I am
          quite organised.  I have always found that I achieve more in less
          time by focussing and avoiding unnecessary distractions.  The awesome thing about Foundations is that
          it is a taste of what bootcamp will be like and allows us to embed our best practices before 
          the hard work starts in January.</p>
        

        <h2>How I'll seek help and my expectations of the facilitation team</h2>
        <p>I am now two weeks in and I plan to focus on reaching out earlier rather than later when I'm having difficulty with a task.
          I've found others on the Kahu cohort extremely helpful and the culture of the Slack channel is really accepting and helpful.
          I've connected with a really great facilitator - John - and I feel able to ask him anything, however large or small.  I'm looking
          forward to making connections with my cohort once we start bootcamp and plan to take the opportunity
          to learn as much as I can from others on the course.
